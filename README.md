# Background of project:
Essentially, CAE contacted UNT a while back about research with a deep reinforcement learning model that could help train pilots in aviation battle scenarios. The funding never went through, so the goal is to create a working model to pitch back to CAE. We want funding from them for a paper. They are also potentially looking for interns.
 
# Where we are at:
At the start of 2022, Rebecca and Mounika created a basic RL model with a relatively basic environment. The graphics were only still images from matplotlib.
In Summer 2022, I essentially completely transformed everything. I adapted the old environment to an OpenAI Gym environment (the latest-one-agent and enemy-ai branches) that uses pygame. I trained the one agent using Stable-Baselines3 PPO and DQN. First we trained it against an agent using random choice (it had the choices forward, shoot, to enemy base, and to enemy plane). Then, I took that trained agent and placed it into the blue plane and trained the red plane against it.

However, we needed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to add more planes. So, I turned that Gym environment into a PettingZoo environment. There were issues training the agents using Stable-Baselines3 because it doesn’t really support MARL, but I got it sorta working. I’m training with PPO right now and it takes a long time to train because of the large observation space. The agents are kinda stupid though.

We’re at the point where basically the environment works as intended, but the behavior after training is not very desirable. We pretty much need a custom Pytorch model that supports multiple agents. Once that’s done and there’s interesting behavior, CAE should be contacted and a paper should be written.

There was a small effort on a Unity game because Unity’s ML-Agents seems much better for this application then pygame and PettingZoo. PettingZoo and other MARL frameworks are also still in their early development stages. However, we didn’t make much progress on that and we didn’t want to throw away our current progress. Unity is likely an easier approach overall, though.

# Steps going forwards:
Custom multi-agent torch model to replace stable baselines
Larger observation space (including friendly plane information)
Assigning roles to each agent (defender, attacker, etc.)
 
# Github:
There’s 3 important branches: latest-one-agent, enemy-ai, and multi-agent-env

latest-one-agent is just a single agent training against a random blue agent

enemy-ai has the blue agent make decisions based off of a pre-trained model

multi-agent-env uses PettingZoo instead of OpenAI Gym and trains multiple planes (it’s way more complex)
 
# Installation Guide:
We’ve been using Anaconda in Python 3.9.12 to run the code

I recommend installing miniconda3 and then using VSCode with the anaconda interpreter. Install miniconda3 from here:

https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

And then install VSCode from here:

https://code.visualstudio.com/

You’ll need to install the python extensions in VSCode

Then, open an anaconda prompt from start menu and run

`conda init powershell`

`code .`

That should open up VSCode through anaconda. After that, you should only need to change the interpreter in the bottom right to miniconda3 base.

As for dependencies, it gets a bit complicated with PZ, Gym, SB3, and Supersuit. The requirements are in the requirements.txt file. Once you install the requirements through pip, you should be able to clone the repo and run the train py file.

To install the dependencies, open a terminal in the git directory and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
# Papers/Tutorials/Docs:
First off, I did a pretty good job at commenting the code in the PettingZoo environment, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to figure out what’s going on

For the PettingZoo environment, the docs and website are super useful:

https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo

https://www.pettingzoo.ml/#
 
This is the template I used to build the PettingZoo environment (from PZ docs):

https://www.pettingzoo.ml/environment_creation#example-custom-parallel-environment
 
Here’s the paper for PettingZoo:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14471
 
For training the PZ environment, the main approach right now for PZ environments is using Stable-Baselines3. Here’s the tutorial that the PettingZoo devs always point to:

The Stable-Baselines3 docs are pretty good for understanding how everything works:
